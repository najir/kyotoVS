My personal Visual Studio Theme.  
Built using Visual Studio Theme Designer as a base. 
Goal is an offwhite and slightly yellow base color with a pastel pink or green accent. Creating a light theme 
that has more color and is slightly better on your eyes, while still being usable in most cases. 
Many changes to be done, currently only the basic colors changed. 
  
  
Currently tested with ASP.Net and C#, colors in any other framework are currently unknown.
